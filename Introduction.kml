<p></p>

<p><b>Introduction</b></p>

<p>The Battle of Fredericksburg was fought between General
Robert E. Lee&acute;s Confederate Army of Northern Virginia and the Major General
Ambrose E. Burnside&acute;s Union Army of the Potomac. It is remembered as one of the
most one-sided battles of the American Civil War in which the Union Army
suffered terrible casualties in frontal assaults on entrenched Confederate
defenders. It is also remembered as one of the most significant artillery
engagements of the war, which is the driving force behind the analysis.</p>

<p><b>Target Audience</b></p>

<p>The audience for this project could really be anyone from
someone just curious about the battle to a student doing a research project on
the effectiveness of artillery in battle. The visuals in the project give
someone that is just taking a glance a good impression of how effective
artillery was used. On the other hand, if someone is doing research on the
battle, they can click on the individual batteries to get a picture and more
detail.</p>

<p><b>Process</b></p>

<p>Using Microdem and other GIS resources I was able to take a
historic map of the battlefield and register it&acute;s location on Google Earth. The
map was originally a jpg2000 file, which was converted to a PNG file which had
to be registered. On the same map I put an overlay of major roads, streams and
railroads using TIGER files from counties Stafford, Spotsylvania and Fredericksburg.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Using a DEM of the area, I was able to make weapon fans the
artillery and make a visual representation of what each battery had the
capability of targeting. This was done for both the Confederate and the Union
artillery batteries. After the weapon fans were completed and adjusted, I made
a database of it, which was placed onto the historic map </p>

<p></p>

<p>This final composite of maps, databases and other information
gives a good visual representation of what each army was able to target using
their artillery batteries and why this battle is considered to be a major
artillery engagement.</p>

<p><b>Summary</b></p>

<p>The entire project was very difficult to start; I had a very
difficult time finding the required information on the batteries and type of
artillery used at each battery. It was obvious that the Battle of
Fredericksburg has a lack of historical information on it compared to more
famous battles such as Antietam and Gettysburg. I also had a very difficult
time registering my historic map. There was no coordinate system on my historic
map which resulted in me having to try and register notable landmarks and
intersections. The accuracy of the registered map compared to the real world is
average at best, but for purposes of the artillery analysis it is still usable.
I learned a great deal from this project, not only on the Battle of
Fredericksburg, but the many capabilities of Microdem and the power that GIS
contains.</p>
